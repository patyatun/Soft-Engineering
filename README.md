## Hangman Game

This project is a implementation of the Hangman Game using Python. 
The main goal is to create an interactive console application that allows users to play Hangman.

### Game description
The game will include the following features:
- The program will prompt the player to enter their name
- The player can choose a theme for the word to be guessed. Available themes include colors, animals and fruits
- Once a theme is choosen, the program will randomly select a word from the choosen theme
- The player will attempt to guess the word by entering letters
- Each unsuccesful attempt will result in the addition of a bodypart to the hangman
- The game will continue until the player guesses the word or the "hangman" is complete
- When the game is over, the player can decide if wants to continue playing or not

### Programming language
The game is being developed in Python due to its simplicity and my personal experience.
Python provides and ideal platform for this project, allowing me to focus on the game logic without getting bogged down in complex implementation details.

### GitHub repository
The complete source and documentation can be found in the following GitHub Repository: https://github.com/patyatun/Soft-Engineering

### Execution instructions
To run the game, clone the repository and execute the *hangman.py* file:

bash
git clone https://github.com/patyatun/Soft-Engineering.git
cd Soft-Engineering
python hangman.py

### Note
This is an initial prototype. More features will be added as the project development progresses.
